## About me
I'm someone who builds, diving into multiple fields from programming languages to electronics,
from cryptography to post quantum cryptography.  

Why those fields?  
They're not the solution to everything, 
but **tools** that will help us **shape** the future.  
**未来の為に。**

I speak English, unnatural Japanese and slowly learning Mandarin.

## Ongoing projects
- [**tsugou**](https://github.com/kai5041/tsugou): A permissioned version control system and builder with Post Quantum Cryptography integration.
- [**xarch**](https://github.com/kai5041/xarch-project): An experimental computer architecture done from scratch.
- [**xuci**](): *Upcoming*

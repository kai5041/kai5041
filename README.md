## About me
I'm someone who builds, diving into multiple fields
from programming languages to electronics, from
cryptography to post quantum cryptography.
Why those fields? They're not the solution to
everything, but tools that will help us shape the
future.

I speak English, unnatural Japanese and slowly
learning Mandarin.
